# Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap will serve as a guide and evolve as this project progresses. Building a library from scratch will be a learning process along the way, making small steps or iterations to improve the overall library. As each iteration is completed on the list below, it will get a strikethrough.

## Goal

Build a react component library to serve the web3 space. The library should be lightweight and flexable for the end user.

## General Specifications

A Wrapper to get props for

- needed user api keys
- set theme

Themes

- light mode
- dark mode
- web3 mode
- custom

Library will include:

- Elements - basic building block components (ie. buttons, badges, switches, ... )
- Components - Common web3 components (Address Display, NFT, Token Balance, ...)
- Hooks - additional hooks that the wagmi library doesn't include. focused more on using common API calls to Nodes like Alchemy or Ankr to get data like NFT information.

   - w/ components, testing and storybook files

2. Create basic components

3. Design files

   - basic figma files of elements and components

4. Basic theme structure

   - a wrapper for end user w/ props to change theme state

5. Apply design

   - make changes to all elements and components to reflect design files

6. Expand testing

   - testing coverage to 50% min

7. Deploy version for testing
   - begin testing package
   - gather user feedback

### Second Iteration

TBD
